## General Info
This browser based web application is to help users manage their tasks efficiently and to organize themselves better. It utilizes the concept of to-do lists to categorize tasks and list them in a checklist. The user then frequently checks their to-do lists and checks each item off until they have everything done. Using TA-DA will help users to stay on top of their tasks and find balance in their work and personal lives.
